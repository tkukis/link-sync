# link-sync

Npm link alternative.
Syncs your test package to your current project.

`npx link-sync -p test-package-in-parent-dir-or-relative-parent-dir -w`

## Motivation

Testing npm packages before publishing to npm using node_modules must  be deleted in your test package to avoid dependencies conflicts. Also it creates  symlinks. You can do it manualy, or use this util.
